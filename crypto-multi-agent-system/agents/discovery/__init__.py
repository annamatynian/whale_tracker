Discovery Agent  
===============

Early token detection through multi-source scanning:
- DEX screener monitoring (new pairs, volume spikes)
- On-chain analysis (new pools, whale movements)
- Social media early signals (contract address mentions)

Implements the critical "speed advantage" - finding tokens 30 seconds to 2 minutes 
before mass discovery.
